    "As technology advances, the food industry constantly works on innovating to keep customers having the best qualities and convenience. Expected food quality, the restaurant industry more and more tends to focus on or how to make customer service more convenient dining. With the rise of delivery options and online platforms, ordering and getting food has become a mainstream form. In 2017, Rafi Cohen shows that a vast majority of millennials (over 70%) states a definite preference for having their food delivered, rather than having to pick it up or dine in. he predicted that over the next few years, this number is only expected to go up as the next generation comes along. How restaurant meals to the home are undergoing rapid change as new online platforms, but no matter what kind of delivery applications, we all need to design model to optimize the interests of the customer and restaurant so that maximization the profit is what our team consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our project, we use mixed-integer programming (MIP) model to optimize the delivery schedule of restaurants and we also wite an algorithm to brute force the solution. From the restaurant to each customer’s home, we will try to get a best route to achieve profit maximization, which means we will minimize total cost (fuel cost and dish cost) and maximize the revenue (tips) as far as possible. Real data would be our pursuit, but since the data is hard to acquire, so we randomly generate data including time of delivery, dishes required, coordinate of delivery destination and tips, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three different examples with the general setting in our project to optimize the profit:\n",

    "\n",
    "We models the delivery route problem using model of traveling saleman problem to find the optimal route that minimize the trip cost for the restaurant delivery. In the first part, we solve the problem by minimize the total trip cost from restuaurant to customers and then back to restuarant. In the second part, we generated a desired order of delivery schedule which is equivalent to maximal customer satifactory schedule. We solve the TSP problem with a tradeoff between minimize trip cost and maxmize customer satisfactory by matching the desired order of delivery. We use L1 norm of delivery order difference as measurement of satisfactory cost. \n",
